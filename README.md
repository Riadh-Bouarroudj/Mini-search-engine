# Mini-search-engine
# Description and explanation
This repository contains a Python implementation of a mini search engine designed for information retrieval from the CACM dataset. The search engine supports both Boolean and vector space models for document retrieval.

This mini search engine is a practical demonstration of basic information retrieval techniques, offering an educational tool for understanding how search engines function. It can be extended and modified for more complex datasets or more advanced retrieval models such as Probabilistic Models and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).
